What's In My Mind!
Serenity!
Utopia!

Adventure awaits!
At least 2 weeks of development!
Break a leg!
Create dreams!
Create nightmares!
Create dreams and nightmares!
Fixed with duct-tape!
Follows us on Twitter!
Game-breaking bugs since 2021!
Join the Discord Server!
It's another game!
Limits are divided by zero!
Look at me dance!
Making TODO lists since 2021!
More than 10 items!
More than 1 biome!
Not enough content!
Now with 2% more grass!
Now with bigger critters!
Press F to pay respects!
Procedurally generated!
Somehow working!
Splash!
Splish!
Splosh!
Stay hydrated!
Technoblade never dies!
Unleash the magic!
Unlimited choices!
Where the magic happens!
Wicked!
Wickedly glitchy!

How?
I guess?
What?
When?
Where?
Who?
Why?

Huh?!
The game is out?!
What?!
What do you mean?!

Above me is the game's name.
Because reality is overrated.
Because you prefer chaos.
Because you were bored.
My name is Mr. Text, Splash Text.
Not responsible for lost hours.
Remember to blink occasionally.
This is a facade, the game is still loading.

Hmm...
Learning calculus for delta timing...
Maurice walks...
Respawning in 3... 2... 1...
Uhh...
What if I change it to an 4...
